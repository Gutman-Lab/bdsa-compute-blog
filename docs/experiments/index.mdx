## Adding Experiments

To add a new experiment:

1. Ensure your experiment outputs a JSON file with the required schema (see README)
2. Place artifacts (JSON + plots) in the appropriate location
3. Run the generator script: `python scripts/generate_experiment_pages.py`
4. Commit and push

The generator will:
- Copy artifacts to `static/artifacts/<run_id>/`
- Generate an MDX page in `docs/experiments/YYYY/`
- Update this leaderboard table
